  - ```<main>```: Main content of the page, only one. What shouldn't go in your main element: logos, copyright information, your site's navigation, sidebars, and anything else that will exist on every page of your website.
  - ```<article>```: Wraps all of the relevant content.
  - ```<Section>```: Defines a portion of article that has a theme or topic of it's own.
- ```<mark>```: Highlights or *marks* part of text.
- ```<summary>```: A visible heading for details.
- ```<time>```: Used to tell the time according to the user's location.
- ```<address>```: Used for E-Mail, Telephone and Addresses.
